# Changelog

All notable changes to inFlow AI are documented here. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **飞书（Feishu / Lark）平台支持** — `feishu.cn` 和 `larksuite.com` 域名纳入平台识别，新增 `FeishuAdapter` 和 `_fetch_feishu()` 使用 Playwright 渲染飞书 SPA（`/docx/`、`/docs/`、`/wiki/`）。含反检测补丁、滚动触发懒加载、登录重定向检测及 `feishu_cookie` 插件设置支持。前端新增「飞书」平台标签。**已知限制**：Wiki 页面（`/wiki/`）正文通过独立鉴权 API 加载，headless Chrome 仅能拿到首屏 ~600 字；完整抓取需配置飞书 Cookie 或后期对接 Open API。

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **🎬 WeChat Channels (视频号) capture** — links from `channels.weixin.qq.com` are now fetched and saved. WeChat Channels pages are JavaScript-rendered, so they are handled by the new generic extraction cascade (below), which renders the page with a headless browser before extracting the main content.
- **🪶 Smart generic extraction cascade** — pages without a dedicated parser (WeChat Channels, CSDN, Juejin, Medium, SSPai, 36Kr, and any other site) now go through a three-stage pipeline for far cleaner main-content extraction:
  1. `trafilatura` extracts the article body from the raw HTML (stable; strips nav/footer/ads);
  2. if the extracted text is too short (a sign of a client-rendered page), the page is rendered with the bundled headless Chromium and re-extracted, keeping the longer result;
  3. as a last resort it falls back to the original BeautifulSoup heuristic cleaner.
  The downstream `clean_to_markdown` pipeline is unchanged — `trafilatura` outputs HTML, so existing processing just works.
- **📄 Article-scoped Q&A** — on an article detail page the assistant can now answer questions **strictly from that one article** (the whole article is fed into context, with no library-wide vector search). A 📄 this-article / 📚 whole-library toggle appears in the chat box on article pages; the explicit `/r` `/a` `/c` commands still escalate to whole-library research/creation.

### Fixed
- **Generic web capture was broken** — the generic fetch path called content-extraction helpers (`_extract_content`, `_extract_title`, `_extract_author`, `_extract_cover`) that were missing, so capturing any site without a dedicated parser would error. These helpers are restored and the path now works end to end.
- **Xiaohongshu image proxying was broken** — the XHS parser called image-proxy helpers (`_proxy_url`, `_proxy_imgs_in_html`) that were missing, so XHS capture would error before saving. These helpers (and the hotlink-protected CDN list) are restored.

### Dependencies
- Added `trafilatura>=2.0.0,<3` and `lxml_html_clean>=0.4.0` (the latter is required because `lxml.html.clean` was split into a standalone package as of lxml 5.2).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-23

Initial open-source release of inFlow AI (拾遗 AI) — a self-hostable, AI-powered second brain for turning saved links into structured, searchable knowledge.

### Added
- Multi-platform article capture with platform-specific parsers (WeChat 公众号, Bilibili, Toutiao, Douyin, Xiaohongshu) plus a generic-web fallback.
- AI processing pipeline: title / summary / key-points / tags / embedding / mind-map.
- RAG Q&A with citations + pgvector semantic search.
- Automatic knowledge graph and learning-path generation.
- WeChat Bot ingress.
- One-way Obsidian sync with revocable sync tokens; multi-tenant support.
- Docker-based self-hosting; responsive UI for PC / pad / mobile.
